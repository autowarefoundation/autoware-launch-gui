## Dependencies

To run the .deb file directly you will need to first check if these dependencies are installed.

```bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0 libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-0 libsoup-3.0-0 libsoup-3.0-common
```

To develop the Autoware Launch GUI, you'll need to have both Rust and Node.js installed on your system.

### Installing Rust

1. To install Rust, run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs/ | sh
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

3. Once installed, you can verify your Rust installation with:

   ```bash
   rustc --version
   ```

   _rustc 1.72.0 (5680fa18f 2023-08-23) is the one i'm currently on while developping this._

### Installing Node.js

1. You can download and install Node.js (LTS Version) from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Alternatively, if you're using a package manager like `apt` for Ubuntu/Debian, you can install Node.js with:

   - For Ubuntu/Debian:

     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install nodejs
     ```

3. Verify your Node.js installation with:

   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

   _v16.20.0 is the one i'm currently on while developping this._

4. It's also recommended to install `pnpm` as it's not included:

   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

Once Rust and Node.js are set up, you can proceed with the [Installation](#installation) steps mentioned above.

## Installation

### Using the .deb File

For most users, the easiest way to get started is by downloading and installing the provided `.deb` file.
It can be found on the releases for this repo at this link [Releases](https://github.com/leo-drive/autoware-launch-gui/releases/)

- After downloading the `.deb` file, navigate to the file in your terminal and run:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install ./autoware-launch-gui_{version}_amd64.deb
  ```

  Replace `{version}` with the version of the `.deb` file you downloaded.

- Once installed, you can launch the Autoware Launch GUI from your applications menu or by running in your terminal(this is preferred as it will show you the logs in case of any errors):

  ```bash
  autoware-launch-gui
  ```

### For Developers

If you're interested in developing additional features or want to run the project from source:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leo-drive/autoware-launch-gui.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd autoware-launch-gui
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

4. Run the development version of the app:

   ```bash
   pnpm tauri dev
   ```
